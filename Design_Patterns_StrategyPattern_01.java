/*The strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

In the case of a duck and its quacking behavior, we can define a `QuackStrategy` interface which will be implemented by various quacking strategies. Then, we can have different classes representing different quacking behaviors, each implementing the `QuackStrategy` interface. Finally, we can have a `Duck` class that has a reference to a `QuackStrategy` and delegates the quacking behavior to it.

Here's a simple example in Java:

```java*/
// QuackStrategy interface
interface QuackStrategy {
    void quack();
}

// Implementations of different quacking strategies
class SimpleQuack implements QuackStrategy {
    @Override
    public void quack() {
        System.out.println("Quack");
    }
}

class Squeak implements QuackStrategy {
    @Override
    public void quack() {
        System.out.println("Squeak");
    }
}

class NoQuack implements QuackStrategy {
    @Override
    public void quack() {
        System.out.println("<< Silence >>");
    }
}

// Duck class
class Duck {
    private QuackStrategy quackStrategy;

    public Duck(QuackStrategy quackStrategy) {
        this.quackStrategy = quackStrategy;
    }

    public void performQuack() {
        quackStrategy.quack();
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Duck duck1 = new Duck(new SimpleQuack());
        Duck duck2 = new Duck(new Squeak());
        Duck duck3 = new Duck(new NoQuack());

        duck1.performQuack(); // Output: Quack
        duck2.performQuack(); // Output: Squeak
        duck3.performQuack(); // Output: << Silence >>
    }
}
/*```

In this example, `QuackStrategy` is the strategy interface, and `SimpleQuack`, `Squeak`, and `NoQuack` are the concrete implementations of different quacking behaviors. The `Duck` class has a `performQuack()` method that delegates the quacking behavior to the `QuackStrategy` object it holds.*/
