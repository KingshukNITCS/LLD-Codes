/* The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern allows the creation of objects that are part of a specific family or group, ensuring that the objects created are compatible. Here's a simple Java program that demonstrates the Abstract Factory design pattern:

```java*/
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

interface ShapeFactory {
    Shape createShape();
}

class RectangleFactory implements ShapeFactory {
    @Override
    public Shape createShape() {
        return new Rectangle();
    }
}

class CircleFactory implements ShapeFactory {
    @Override
    public Shape createShape() {
        return new Circle();
    }
}

public class AbstractFactoryPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeFactory rectangleFactory = new RectangleFactory();
        Shape rectangle = rectangleFactory.createShape();
        rectangle.draw();

        ShapeFactory circleFactory = new CircleFactory();
        Shape circle = circleFactory.createShape();
        circle.draw();
    }
}
/*```

In this example, we have an interface called `Shape` which defines the common behavior for different shapes. The `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes implement this interface and provide their respective implementations for the `draw` method.

We then introduce the `ShapeFactory` interface, which serves as the abstract factory. It declares the `createShape` method, which returns a `Shape` object. The `RectangleFactory` and `CircleFactory` classes implement this interface and provide concrete implementations of the `createShape` method to create `Rectangle` and `Circle` objects respectively.

In the `main` method, we create instances of `RectangleFactory` and `CircleFactory`, and use them to create `Rectangle` and `Circle` objects. We call the `draw` method on these objects, which is implemented differently in each shape class.

The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. By using the abstract factory, we decouple the client code from the specific implementations of the objects being created. This allows for flexibility in switching between different families of objects, ensuring that the objects created are compatible within the same family.
