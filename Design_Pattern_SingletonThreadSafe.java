/*To make the singleton pattern thread-safe in a distributed system, you can use double-checked locking along with volatile keyword to ensure that only one instance of the singleton is created and that it is properly synchronized across threads. Here's the modified code:

```java*/
class DatabaseConnection {
    private static volatile DatabaseConnection instance;
    private String connectionString;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation outside the class
    private DatabaseConnection() {
        // Simulating database connection setup
        connectionString = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
    }

    // Lazy initialization of the singleton instance with double-checked locking
    public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (DatabaseConnection.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new DatabaseConnection();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connected to database: " + connectionString);
    }

    // Other database-related methods can be added here
}

// Client code
public class SingletonExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the singleton instance
        DatabaseConnection dbConnection = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();

        // Connect to the database
        dbConnection.connect();
    }
}
/*
```

In this modified code:

- The `volatile` keyword ensures that changes made to the `instance` variable are immediately visible to other threads. This prevents the possibility of reading stale values of the `instance` variable in a multi-threaded environment.
- The `synchronized` block inside the `getInstance()` method ensures that only one thread can create the instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class at a time. This prevents multiple threads from concurrently creating multiple instances of the singleton, which could happen in a distributed system with multiple threads trying to access the `getInstance()` method simultaneously.
- Double-checked locking is used to avoid the synchronization overhead incurred every time the `getInstance()` method is called. It ensures that synchronization is only applied when the instance needs to be created, improving performance in scenarios where the instance is already initialized.*/
