In this updated example, we introduce the remaining GRASP principles:

1. Indirection: The `OrderProcessor` interface serves as an indirection layer between the `GRASPPrincipleExample` class and the actual order processing implementations, `OnlineOrderProcessor` and `InStoreOrderProcessor`. It allows the `GRASPPrincipleExample` class to work with any implementation of the `OrderProcessor` interface without being directly dependent on specific implementations.

2. Polymorphism: The `OrderProcessor` interface provides a common contract for order processing, and the `GRASPPrincipleExample` class can use different implementations of `OrderProcessor` (e.g., `OnlineOrderProcessor` and `InStoreOrderProcessor`) interchangeably. This enables polymorphism, where the behavior of the `processOrder` method can vary based on the actual implementation.

3. Protected Variations: The `EmailNotification` class and `SMSNotification` class act as protected variations for sending email and SMS notifications respectively. They encapsulate the logic for sending these notifications, allowing for flexibility in how notifications are sent without affecting the core order processing logic.

4. Pure Fabrication: The `EmailNotification` and `SMSNotification` classes are pure fabrications because they don't represent real-world entities but are created solely to fulfill the need for sending email and SMS notifications. They provide a dedicated capability that is not directly related to order processing.

By incorporating these additional GRASP principles, we enhance the design by introducing indirection, leveraging polymorphism, protecting against variations, and incorporating pure fabrications. This results in a more flexible and maintainable codebase. */
