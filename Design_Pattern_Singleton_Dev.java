/* The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point to access it. Here's a simple Java program illustrating the Singleton pattern in the context of a database connection:*/

// Singleton class for database connection
class DatabaseConnection {
    private static DatabaseConnection instance;
    private String connectionString;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation outside the class
    private DatabaseConnection() {
        // Simulating database connection setup
        connectionString = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
    }

    // Lazy initialization of the singleton instance
    public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new DatabaseConnection();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connected to database: " + connectionString);
    }

    // Other database-related methods can be added here
}

// Client code
public class SingletonExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the singleton instance
        DatabaseConnection dbConnection = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();

        // Connect to the database
        dbConnection.connect();
    }
}

/* In this example, DatabaseConnection is a singleton class representing a database connection. The class has a private constructor to prevent external instantiation, and the getInstance method ensures lazy initialization of the singleton instance. This pattern is useful for scenarios like managing a single database connection throughout the application.*/
